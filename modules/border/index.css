  Theory for spacing/sizing/scaling

  - this set contains:
    - font size - .8, 1, 2, 4, 8, 10
    - white space (margin, padding) - 0, .5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
    - border thickness - 0, .5, 1, 2, 4

  - of the above, fonts should come with least amount of options, but still more options than Basscss (need more options for larger text)

  - I often want to have a padding/margin of 10rem. I don't see why scaling up to (at least) this isn't ok. I hear the 2 times rule (.5, 1, 2, 4, 8), but I want more options. Maybe this is an example of the lack of clarity on my part, maybe not seeing only using .5, 1, 2, and 4 is a symptom of my sloppyness, but i like options and tend to try other sizes than those 4. And __a big thing of what this approach is about is to be able to design/iterate in the browser via html__, so having options available to you is !important. I'm not trying to beat the achivements in small sizes made by basscss/tachyons/gemma, et al. I believe the approach is nimble enough to allow for more options at development time, and that's what this approach is about.
